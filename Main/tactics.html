      <h3>How to Create Indomitable Will</h3>

      <p>After having a major setback at an entrepreneurial venture. In November 2015 I went into a deep depression. I was stuck in bed, feeling sorry myself. All I wanted to do was lie in bed and feel sorry for myself. I would get up once and awhile just to find distractions that would take my focus off my personal problems. I would occasionally get out of bed to see my beautiful wife and child. I would hear my son’s voice and I hated myself even more because my actions or my inactions would only lead my family to ruin.</p>

      <p>So, I decided to change one more time. I’ve done this before, I’ve had major pivots in my life before only to revert back into that sad state where I hated my life, myself and dreading the future ahead. But, this time it was going to be different. This time, I’m going to make these positive changes stick. This time my hunger for positive change will never be quenched. From all the knowledge, I’ve gathered from the world of motivation. I started to try again.  </p>

      <h3> The 5 Minute Technique</h3>

      <p>Everyday you do something you dread for five minutes. I started waking up five minutes earlier. I was waking up at 2 p.m. at the time, so, this was not a challenge. Everyone who’s having trouble with lack of willpower is sitting in front of what seems to be Herculean task. </p>
